# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Client Build Directory Error
**Problem**: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/opt/render/project/src/client/build/index.html'`

**Solution**: 
- Added conditional static file serving in `server.js`
- Server now checks if client build directory exists before trying to serve static files
- For backend-only deployments, returns API information instead of trying to serve non-existent files

### 2. ✅ NPM Audit Vulnerabilities
**Problem**: 21 vulnerabilities (17 low, 2 moderate, 2 critical)

**Solution**:
- Updated all dependencies to latest secure versions
- Added security scripts to package.json
- Updated vulnerable packages:
  - axios: ^1.6.0 → ^1.7.7
  - dotenv: ^16.3.1 → ^16.4.5
  - ethers: ^6.8.1 → ^6.13.4
  - express: ^4.18.2 → ^4.21.1
  - express-rate-limit: ^7.1.5 → ^7.4.1
  - helmet: ^7.1.0 → ^8.0.0
  - node-fetch: ^2.6.9 → ^3.3.2
  - web3: ^4.2.2 → ^4.11.0
  - redis: ^4.6.12 → ^4.7.0
  - hono: ^4.5.10 → ^4.9.6

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Error Handling
**Problem**: Generic error handling for file not found errors

**Solution**:
- Added specific handling for ENOENT errors
- Improved error logging and response formatting
- Enhanced health check endpoint with detailed system information

### 4. ✅ Backend-Only Deployment Support
**Problem**: Server trying to serve frontend files in backend-only deployment

**Solution**:
- Added conditional logic to detect backend-only deployments
- Returns helpful API information for non-API routes
- Prevents file not found errors

## Files Modified

1. **server.js**
   - Added conditional static file serving
   - Enhanced error handling for ENOENT errors
   - Added backend-only deployment support

2. **package.json**
   - Updated all dependencies to secure versions
   - Added security audit scripts
   - Added npm audit fix automation

3. **server/routes/api.js**
   - Enhanced health check endpoint with detailed system information
   - Added memory usage and recovery statistics

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Commit and push changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment errors and security vulnerabilities"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Render will automatically redeploy** with the fixes

3. **Verify the fixes**:
   - Health check: `GET https://tokenrecoverysystem-a.onrender.com/api/health`
   - Root endpoint: `GET https://tokenrecoverysystem-a.onrender.com/`
   - Registration: `POST https://tokenrecoverysystem-a.onrender.com/api/register-recovery`

## Expected Results After Deployment

- ✅ No more ENOENT errors in logs
- ✅ Reduced security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Proper backend-only deployment support
- ✅ Enhanced health check endpoint
- ✅ All API endpoints working correctly

## Backend Status: ✅ WORKING

The backend server is functioning correctly:
- Server started successfully
- Running on port 10000
- API available at `/api`
- All supported networks loaded
- Service is live at `https://tokenrecoverysystem-a.onrender.com`

The errors shown in the deployment logs are non-critical and don't prevent the backend from functioning.
